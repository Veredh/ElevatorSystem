# ElevatorSystem
 This project is an elevator system of a 7 floors building, containing two elevators.
 This project was built using VSCode framework using web technologies (JS, CSS, HTML).

 
 Known Issues (Due to shortness of time I did not have time to resolve):
 1. The sound of the elevator arrival is in a bit delay.
 2. When closing the broswer and opening it again, the global variable remain as they were, and won't reset.
 3. For convenience - when entering the elevator, one can only press one floor.
